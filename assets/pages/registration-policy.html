						<h2>General</h2>
						By registering every participant declares to the ETDS committee that they agree with the registration regulations, the competition regulations and the privacy statement.
						<br><br>
						The ETDS committee reserves the right to diverge from the rules stated in the document to rule in individual cases if conflict should arise.
						<br><br>
						If a participant does not follow the conditions stated in this document, the ETDS committee reserves the right to deny this participant access to the event.

						<h2>Registration Procedure</h2>
						Registration will open on 9th of March. If the number of registrations exceeds the number of places, participants are selected by lottery.
						<br><br>
						After the lottery, when a participant drops out, that place will be taken by someone from the waiting list through a lottery.
						<br><br>
						Registration does not guarantee participation to the tournament, due to the lottery system.
						<br><br>
						The team captain is responsible for the registration of his/her team members via the by the ETDS organization administered registration system.
						<br><br>
						Team captains register themselves as team captain in the registration system and will be exempted from the lottery. The number of team captains exempted from the lottery are:
						<p>1 for 3 or more participants (not including the team captain)</p>
						<p>2 for 18 or more participants (not including the team captains)</p>

						<h2>Cancellations</h2>
						One week after the registration closes, the team captain will receive a final list of participants with a waiting list.
						<br><br>
						Whenever a participant cancels, his/her place will be taken by someone from the waiting list. The system will maintain the following priorities:
						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The spot will be filled by a participant from the waiting list from any team, by random lottery done by the ETDS organization. Preference will go to a participant that will stabilize the balance between lead/follow in the blind date groups.</li>
							<li>It is not allowed to participate under someone else’s name. If done so, the participant will be disqualified and their team captain may also be disqualified if he/she allowed it.</li>
							<li>If a participant on the waiting list isn’t available for the ETDS anymore they are required to let the ETDS organization know via their team captain. The participant can be taken out of the lottery system then.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Finances</h2>
						For the registration fee, a distinction is made between students, PhD students, and non-students:
						<li>Students pay 120 CHF</li>
						<li>PhD students pay 170 CHF</li>
						<li>Non-students pay 220 CHF</li>
						<br>
						If a registered member is moved from the waiting list to the participants list, their fee needs to be paid to the ETDS committee within 10 days, or else their registration will be cancelled.
						<br><br>
						If the ETDS takes place before the payment deadline is met, the participation fee needs to be paid before the start of the ETDS.
						<br>
						<h2>Restitution of participation fee:</h2>
						<li>A participant will get full restitution if they cancel before 11th of May and the empty
							spot can be filled. Full restitution will be given to the participant’s association.</li>
						<li>A participant will receive partial restitution of the participation fee, 75%, if he/she
							cancels between the 12th of May and the 25th of May and the empty spot can be
							filled. This partial restitution will be given latest to the participant’s association on
							December 1st at the latest.</li>
						<li>A participant will receive no restitution of the participation fee if he/she
							cancels after the 25th of May.</li>
						<li>If the empty spot cannot be filled or the participant does not cancel prior to the start of
							the ETDS, no restitution is provided.</li>
						Associations are expected to make sure that restitutions go back to the person it belongs to. We will provide the necessary information.
						<br><br>
						If a participant signs up as a student or PhD student, they need to bring proof of registration to the tournament. If they cannot show the required document when asked, they need to pay remaining non-student fee cash at the registration desk at the ETDS. A student card without the year 2023/2024 on it will not be accepted as proof of registration.

						<h2>Obligatory Helping Hours</h2>
						During the ETDS every team is mandatory to fill obligatory helping hours (OHHs). More information about these helping shifts can be found on our website.
						<br><br>
						The tasks for the OHHs may include but are not limited to:
						<ul>
							<li>Welcome desk</li>
							<li>Information desk</li>
							<li>Blind dating desk</li>
							<li>Night guard</li>
							<li>Badge checking</li>
							<li>Construction and deconstruction</li>
							<li>Dinner assistance</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						After being chosen by the lottery, your team is assigned a number of OHHs, the team captain will then distribute them among the team members.

						<h2>Damages</h2>
						Damages caused by the negligence of the participants, or their inability to follow rules, will be recovered from said participant. This includes, but is not limited to, damages caused by:
						<ul>
							<li>Smoking</li>
