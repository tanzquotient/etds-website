						<h2>General</h2>
						By registering every participant declares to the ETDS committee that they agree with the registration regulations, the competition regulations and the privacy statement.
						<br><br>
						The ETDS committee reserves the right to diverge from the rules stated in the document to rule in individual cases if conflict should arise.
						<br><br>
						If a participant does not follow the conditions stated in this document, the ETDS committee reserves the right to deny this participant access to the event.

						<h2>Registration Procedure</h2>
						Divided over the months June, July and August there will be 2 regular lottery rounds. Meaning there are 3 registration deadlines and 3 payment deadlines.
						The payment deadline is always 10 days after a participant has been selected:
						<br><br>
						<b>Round 1:</b>
						<br><p>18 June, payment due 28 June, ±400 selections</p>
						<b>Round 2:</b>
						<br><p>16 July, payment due 26 July, ±200 selections</p>
						<br>
						After the third lottery round, when a participant drops out, that place will be taken by someone from the waiting list through a lottery.
						<br><br>
						Registration does not guarantee participation to the tournament, due to the lottery system.
						<br><br>
						The team captain is responsible for the registration of his/her team members via the by the ETDS organization administered registration system.
						<br><br>
						Team captains register themselves as team captain in the registration system and will be exempted from the lottery. The number of team captains exempted from the lottery are:
						<p>1 for 3 or more participants (not including the team captain)</p>
						<p>2 for 20 or more participants (not including the team captains)</p>

						<h2>Cancellations</h2>
						One week after the registration closes, the team captain will receive a final list of participants with a waiting list.
						<br><br>
						Whenever a participant cancels, his/her place will be taken by someone from the waiting list. The system will maintain the following priorities:
						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The spot will be filled by a participant from the waiting list from any team, by random lottery done by the ETDS organization. Preference will go to a participant that will stabilize the balance between lead/follow in the blind date groups.</li>
							<li>It is not allowed to participate under someone else’s name. If done so, the participant will be disqualified and their team captain may also be disqualified if he/she allowed it.</li>
							<li>If a participant on the waiting list isn’t available for the ETDS anymore they are required to let the ETDS organization know via their team captain. The participant can be taken out of the lottery system then.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Finances</h2>
						Within 10 days after the results of the lottery, each association has to pay the participation fees to the ETDS committee. If these are not paid with these 10 days the registered spots will be opened for the next lottery round.
						<br><br>
						For the registration fee, a distinction is made between students, PhD. students, and non-students:
						<li>Students pay €75</li>
						<li>PhD. students pay €100</li>
						<li>Non-students pay €100</li>
						<br>
						If a registered member is moved from the waiting list to the participants list, their fee needs to be paid to the ETDS committee within 10 days, or else their registration will be cancelled.
						<br><br>
						If the ETDS takes place before the payment deadline is met, the participation fee needs to be paid before the start of the ETDS.
						<br>
						<h2>Restitution of participation fee:</h2>
						For a clear overview, see the diagram above.
						<li>A participant will get full restitution if they cancel before September 1st 2022 and the empty
							spot can be filled. Full restitution will be given to the participant’s association on
							November 1st at the latest.</li>
						<li>A participant will receive partial restitution of the participation fee, 50%, if he/she
							cancels between the 1st of September and the 1st of October and the empty spot can be
							filled. This partial restitution will be given latest to the participant’s association on
							November 1st latest.</li>
						<li>A participant will receive no restitution of the participation fee if he/she
							cancels after the 1st of October.</li>
						<li>If the empty spot cannot be filled or the participant does not cancel prior to the start of
							the ETDS, no restitution is provided.</li>
						Associations are expected to make sure that restitutions go back to the person it belongs to. We will provide the necessary information.
						<br><br>
						If a participant signs up as a student, they need to bring proof of registration to the tournament. If they cannot show the required document when asked, they need to pay remaining non-student fee cash at the registration desk at the ETDS. A student card without the year 2022/2023 on it will not be accepted as proof of registration.

						<h2>Obligatory Helping Hours</h2>
						During the ETDS October 2022 every team is mandatory to fill obligatory helping hours (OHHs). More information about these helping shifts can be found on our website.
						<br><br>
						The tasks for the OHHs may include but are not limited to:
						<ul>

							<li>Night guard</li>
							<li>Badge checking</li>
							<li>Construction and deconstruction</li>
							<li>Dinner assistance</li>
							<li>Bar shift</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Damages</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Smoking</li>
