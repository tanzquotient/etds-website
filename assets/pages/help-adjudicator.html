								Adjudicators that are not on time (or ask questions which would have been answered if they had shown up to the earlier briefing) will be required to do a forfeit.
								The forfeit may include doing 10 pushups in the middle of the dance floor with everyone watching, or anything else deemed fit by the organizing committee.
