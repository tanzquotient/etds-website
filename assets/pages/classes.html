						<h2>Blind Dating</h2>
						<p>
							Blind dating means that you find a dance partner on site on Friday evening.
							It is a lot of fun to dance a competition with a partner with
							whom you do not dance regularly, and who might even be from another country!
							We highly recommend it, since it is a great way to connect to other teams.
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<p>
							In Breitensport, blind dating is <b>voluntary</b> or <b>mandatory</b> depending on your previous competition experience.
							Please check the classes overview.
							In ClOpen, there is <b>no blind dating</b> as the partner lottery starts already in the qualification round.
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<p>
							You can find different partners for Standard and Latin.
							The main blind dating round will be on Friday for Standard and Latin.
							There will be a second blind dating round for Latin on Saturday evening.
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<p>
							For the blind dating, the floor is going to be divided so that you can go to the area corresponding to your level.
							This will facilitate finding a partner whose level matches yours.
							Music will play for short periods of time (30 to 60 seconds), after which you will switch to a new partner.
							Once two people agree that they want to compete together, you can come to the info desk to register as a couple.
						</p>

						<h3>Blind Dating Rules</h3>

						<p>The following rules apply:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Voluntary blind daters have no restrictions on their partner.</li>
							<li>Mandatory blind daters have the following restrictions:
								<ul>
									<li>
										You cannot blind date someone with whom, in the past 3 years,
										you have competed (ETDS, NTDS, other competition, etc.)
										or trained together.
									</li>
									<li>You cannot blind date someone from your own team.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Mandatory blind dating only applies to your usual role as lead/follow.
								If you register to dance in the opposite role then blind dating is voluntary.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Partner Lottery</h2>
						<p>
							For some categories, there will be a lottery system instead of blind dating.
							This lottery determines for each round and for each dance which partner you will dance with.

							<ul>
								<li>Champions and Legends: from quarterfinal onwards</li>
								<li>ClOpen: all rounds, including qualification</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12>">
					<div class="left-align">
						<h2>ClOpen</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If you have competition experience and/or have danced in a high class in a previous ETDS,
								check the classes overview to see if you should dance in the ClOpen category.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you dance this class in one discipline (Standard or Latin), this does not affect your other discipline.
							</li>
							<li>
								In addition to your competition in the CloseD or Open Class, we plan to integrate
								a special kind of rounds into the competition schedule that will have the aim to foster
								the interaction between dancers in higher and lower classes (details to be announced).
								We expect all ClOpen dancers to support our initiative by being available to participate in these rounds.
