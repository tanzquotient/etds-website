					The ETDS ZÃ¼rich will make use of the lottery system as implemented by the xTDS system.
					<br><br>
					The lottery system has the purpose of reducing stress in the registration period while ensuring a balance between leads and follows.
					Furthermore, it guarantees that any team that signs up gets the possibility to represent themselves during the ETDS.
					<br><br>
					For more information regarding the registration procedure, see the <a href="#/registration-policy">registration policy</a>.

						<h2>Conditions</h2>
						In order to fairly select the participants for the ETDS, a lottery system will be used. The lottery system randomly drafts people from the registration list that are selected for participation. In order to give all registrants a fair chance of participating, the lottery system takes into account the following conditions.										<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Couples registered together will not be split up.</li>
							<li>Team captains are guaranteed to participate, the number of team captains depends on the size of the team.</li>
							<li>Participants are selected to maintain leader/follower balance in all classes.</li>
							<li>Registrants who have not joined an ETDS before have a slight preference in the lottery system.</li>
							<li>Registrants who registered in the previous ETDS but were not drafted have a very slight preference in the lottery system. For this, signup with the same email address is crucial. </li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Rounds</h2>
						One main lottery rounds will be held, selecting the majority of the participants.
						Further selections will be made based on cancellations and evening out the lead/follow counts.

						<h2>Partners</h2>
						If a person who registered with a partner gets drafted, that partner will also be selected for participation automatically. Therefore, a dancing couple that registers together will always be selected together.
						<br><br>
						If a person who registered without a partner gets drafted, the lottery system will select an additional person who registered without a partner. This additional person will be selected based on what is needed to maintain a good leader/follower balance. This will make sure that as many participants as possible can find a partner during blind dating.
						<h2>Selection Procedure</h2>
						At least 90% of the participants will be selected using the lottery system outlined above. The remaining spots are reserved for special purposes including but not limited to: the organization, tournament office, super-volunteers, first-aid volunteers, other specific volunteer functions, last-minute balancing of leader/follower distribution. These spots are appointed by the organization.
