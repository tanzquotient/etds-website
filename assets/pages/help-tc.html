					So... Your team members are asking you all sorts of things and you would just like one page with all the information?
					We've made a page just for that! While you can simply direct the participants to one of the other help pages, this one is tailored just for you.
					<br><br>
					If anything is still unclear, please <a href="/#contact">contact us</a>.
					However, if you ask a question that is clearly mentioned on the website or in the info document, you owe the committee a drink ðŸ˜‰.
