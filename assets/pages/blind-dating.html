				<p>
					Every participant of the ETDS is allowed to blind date.
					Depending on your level of dancing in which you are dancing, you may be obligated to blind date.
					You can find the class in which you have to dance on the <a href="/#/classes">the classes page</a>.
				</p>
				<br>
				<b>Note:</b> If you are obligated to blind date as a Breitensport dancer in your usual role as lead/follow,
				you may choose to dance in the opposite role and have no restrictions to the blind dating (i.e. voluntary blind dating).
