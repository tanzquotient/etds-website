				<p>
					The ETDS is only possible due to the many hours of volunteer work we put in as a community.
					Besides the organization of the event, there are a lot of tasks that have to be done during the weekend.
					For these tasks we need your help! We have organized all the work that needs to be done during the weekend in shifts.
					These shifts are typically a 1 hour duty after which the next person takes over. The shifts are organised in three categories.
				</p>
				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 left-align">
					<h2>Obligatory Helping Hours (OHH)</h2>
					All teamcaptains receive a list of obligatory shifts for their team, constituting to 1 hour per participant.
					It is up to the teamcaptains how to distribute these shifts over their team members.

					<h2>Volunteer shifts</h2>
					Next to the obligatory helping hours, many people contribute to the ETDS by taking additional volunteer shifts.
					Apart from a great experience and our eternal gratitude as a community, your team will earn points for the Tanzmaus for every additional volunteer hour..

					<h2>Super volunteers</h2>
					Super volunteers are the backbone of the ETDS and are the people who are volunteering the whole weekend for a minimum of 25 hours.
					Therefore, as a super-volunteer you will not be able to participate in the tournament.
					However, to compensate for your contribution you will receive food, a sleeping spot and a wonderful experience <b>free of charge</b>.
					Registration for the super-volunteers is handled
