					So... This is your first ETDS and you have no idea what's going on? Then this page is for you!
					You can find all the basic information you need to know before and during the weekend right here on this page.
					<br><br>
<!--					<span class="pink">â˜…</span> <b>means this topic is still uncertain and the info here is likely wrong!</b>-->
<!--					<br><br>-->
					For all questions, make sure you check with your team captain first. If they don't know, ask them to ask us.
					That way, we can keep all information flowing through the correct channels. If they don't respond, however,
					and you're panicking, then of course you can send us an email.
<!--					<br><br>-->
<!--					Would you rather have a single document you can have ready at all times, maybe even print out? (#notatreehugger).-->
<!--					Just download our mini-info-document. A single document that gives you all the information you could possibly need for the ETDS!-->
<!--					We will be updating the document if anything is unclear or as more information is added.-->

								The ETDS is a weekend filled with dancing, a tournament, dancing parties, socializing, shows and much more.
								It starts on Friday evening and ends on Monday morning.
								This means you will stay at the same venue for the entire weekend, where you will dance, eat and sleep. (With some exceptions)
								The whole weekend is themed. In this case the theme is "Above the Clouds". More on this later!

								While some people choose to deviate from the general planning, for example arriving later or leaving earlier, the typical weekend looks like this:
								<br><br>
								You arrive on Friday. First you drop your stuff in the sleeping halls. You get changed (or not) and head to the tournament hall.
								This is where all the dancing takes place.
								This evening is all about blind dating (finding a partner). If you already have a partner, it's just a social dancing night!
								<br><br>
								On Saturday you will be dancing your Standard tournament.
								At some point, there will be a team presentation in which all teams introduce themselves.
								Even if you are out of the tournament, it is a lot of fun to stay, watch and cheer on your team mates.
								Brunch is included.
								After the tournament, there will be a small break after which dinner will be served.
								You have some time to freshen up before the evening will continue with the theme party. Everyone dresses up in a theme outfit.
								Often your team will have a certain take on the theme. Then a whole fun night of dancing ensues which continues until the last person goes to sleep!
								<br><br>
								Sunday is a repeat of Saturday with just a few differences. Firstly, you will be dancing Latin.
								And secondly, rather than a theme party, there will be a gala night.
								Once again, the dancing will continue until the last person goes to sleep!
								<br><br>
								After waking up on Monday, you will start by packing up your stuff. We all meet again at breakfast where everybody says their goodbyes to their (new) friends.
								We ask everyone to stay a bit to help clearing up the big things. Then everyone leaves back to their respective cities with many great new memories.

								Most people are sleeping in a sports hall.
								These halls are literally a hop, skip and a quickstep run away from the tournament hall.
								Every team has their own area, so you are sure to have a spot with people you know.
								As such, you should take your own air mattress, pump, sleeping bag, etc.
								<br><br>
								Some people, however, choose to sleep elsewhere. For example at friends or in a hotel.
								This is your own choice, of course. Make sure that if you do change your mind about where you sleep, that you let your team captain know.
								This is because it is important for us to know how many people are sleeping at the venue.

								That is correct. Every participant is expected to help out to make the ETDS happen. Only in this way can we keep the costs low.
								Every team is assigned a number of OHHs (Obligatory Helping Hours). Division of these goes through the team captain.
								<br><br>
								Want to help out more? Great! You can enter this in the portal after <a href="https://whitsun.xtds.dance/">logging in</a>.
								If this doesn't work, or you don't know what to do, contact your team captain.

								In other words, it's fun if everybody joins in.

								At the ETDS, real competition clothing is not allowed.
								This normally means; no full dresses or tail suits, no feathers and stones etc.
								Most importantly, you should wear something you feel good in and can dance comfortably in.
								It should not restrict your movement.
								<br><br>
								<b>For the ladies:</b><br>
								Wear a simple dress or skirt. I normally wear my trainings skirt. Take something that covers breasts, belly and buttocks. Wear short pants underneath your skirt if you are not sure everything is covered while moving ;). For the ladies heel protectors are required.
								<br><br>
								<b>For the men:</b><br>
								Donâ€™t wear jackets! They have shoulder pads that look very ugly when keeping your arms up.
								Wearing a vest (waistcoat) and a button down shirt is recommended.
								Moreover, choose trousers in which you can move freely.
								Dancing shoes are preferred, however dress shoes are acceptable too. Just make sure not to wear sneakers.

								In the first round, we will split the group in half.
								Then in the second qualification round, each group will be split into four.
								Resulting in 8 classes in total.
								<br><br>
								Once you are placed in a class, you will compete against the other couples in your class, starting with your preliminary round.
								From this round, some couples will be placed through to the next round and some will be eliminated.
								<br><br>
								This process continues between rounds until 6 couples remain in the final. Do note that in later rounds you may have to dance <a href="#/dances">more dances</a>.
								<br><br>
								All couples that were in the semi-final are called to the entrance of the floor at the start of the final.
								Then one by one, the finalists are called onto the floor. Together they will dance the final round.

								Through the lottery system we have made sure that there are an equal number of leaders and followers.
								<br><br>
								Throughout the evening (and even some more on saturday night) there will be several rounds of speed-dating-dancing.
								You will have several 30-second dances with different dance partners.
								Once you find the partner of choice, you sign up together at the registration desk.
								You don't need the same partner for standard and latin, but it is allowed.

								In general, don't be too worried. Your team captain and teamies are there to help you find that awesome dance partner.

								Aaah, that's a difficult one. All judges have their specific things which they pay attention to.
								Of course they look at whether you are dancing in rhythm, do the correct technique, etc.
								However, they may also look at how you get on and off the floor. Or how you present yourself at the end of the dance.
								<br><br>
								Several tips from an experienced dancer to the beginners:
								<ul>
									<li>Don't think too hard about technique on the floor, then it's too late already</li>
									<li>Your round starts the moment you walk onto the floor, not when the first music plays.
										Similarly, your round only ends the moment you walk off the floor, not after your presentation.</li>
									<li>You are dancing for yourself and for the audience in the first place. Judges come second. So show you're having fun!</li>
									<li>If everybody around is is clearly clapping in a different beat than in which you are dancing, you're likely out of rhythm.
										Stop, take a deep breath, and try again. There's no harm in that!</li>
									<li>Most importantly: <b>have fun!</b></li>
