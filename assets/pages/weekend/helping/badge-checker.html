					In this shift you take place at the entry of the tournament hall or sleeping halls and ask people going in or out to show their wristband or visitor badge.
					This is necessary to keep unwanted guests away from the event and your belongings.

						<h2>Starting your shift</h2>
						At the beginning of your shift you go to the <a href="/assets/img/weekend/maps/HelperPosts.png" target="_blank">badge checking location</a> at where you’re scheduled.
						There you will find the other volunteer that is scheduled for this shift, and the two volunteers from the previous shift.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Wait for the two volunteers from the next shift to arrive, provide them with the necessary instructions and release yourself from your duties.
						<br><br>
						If after 5 minutes past your shifts the next volunteers have not arrived, one of you should inform the manager volunteers (at the info desk).

						<h2>During your shift</h2>
						Anyone with a shirt that indicates they are an employee at X may enter without a badge or bracelet. When in doubt, please contact the orga team.
						<br><br>
						In case an adjudicator has to quickly leave to the toilet, but they forgot their badge, feel free to let them pass.
						<br><br>
						If you have to go to the bathroom or leave your place at any time during the shift,
						please make sure that there is always at least one person at your badge checking location.

						<h2>At the tournament hall (X3):</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>There will be a pile of VIP badges for adjudicators and some others. If they show some form of ID, you can hand them their badge.</li>
							<li>There will be visitors coming that have to buy an entrance badge. More info on that under the header "Visitors badges"</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>At the sleeping halls (X1/2):</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Visitors are not allowed in the sleeping halls</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Visitor badges</h2>
						Visitors are required to buy their badge from you at the first entry.
						A payment terminal will be available at the badge checking location at the entrance of the tournament hall X3.
						You will charge them the correct amount for a ticket and hand them their badge.
						<br><br>
						All payments are done by card. Cash is not accepted. For this, a tablet and a pin machine is used.
						To find out how to process payments check the <a href="/#/weekend/helping/pin">pin machine help page</a> for more information.
						<br><br>
						Visitors during the day have no prerequisites and only need to pay to enter. They will have to leave after the tournament.
						If they also want to stay for the evening, they will have to come back and buy the next badge then. Badges cannot be bought in advance.
						<br><br>
						Visitors during the night are only allowed if they have registered in advance. A list of registered visitors will be available.
						<br><br>
						Those that have not registered in advance but still want to enter will have to do the following steps:
						<ul>
							<li>Have them contact someone that can vouch for them, who is already a participant</li>
							<li>Let that person contact their team captain.</li>
							<li>The team captain has to give an ok as they are now responsible for this visitor.</li>
							<li>The visitor has to fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/xy2JCaY4hec32AKZ7">this form</a> and pay for the visitor ticket.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do: contact the volunteer manager somewhere in the tournament hall.
