						<h2>At the start of the ETDS</h2>
						You will have a briefing with one of the committee members to learn about the relevant protocols in this venue;
						here we will also collect your contact details such that we know how to reach you when we need you in case of emergency.

						<h2>Starting your shift</h2>
						If you have a shift during the day: at the beginning of your shift you go to the info desk and check-in with the manager volunteers;
						it is important that they know you’re there.
						<br><br>
						If you have a shift during the night and you’re asleep at the beginning of the shift: you can keep sleeping peacefully.
						A pylon will be placed in front of your bed to indicate that you’re the person that is on first-aid duty and can be woken up when necessary.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager volunteers, inform them of anything that they should know and release yourself from your shift.
						If you’re asleep at the end of your shift: keep sleeping.

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do: contact the manager volunteers.

						<h2>During your shift</h2>
						There is a dedicated first-aid professional for the sports facility that is around 24/7,
						your main task is to support this person and be the first point of care when this person is not in the tournament hall.
						<br><br>
						Your shift is a standby shift, that means that you don't need to sit at the first-aid station all the time;
						during your shift you can compete/dance/party, we only need you to be in the tournament hall and be available to help when needed.
						<br><br>
						We ask you to take care of yourself such that you can handle your shift in a responsible way;
						this means that you are (relatively) well-rested and do not drink alcohol before or during your shift.
						If you are on duty, or are starting a shift soon, and you feel like you cannot continue this duty in a responsible manner:
						let the manager volunteers know as soon as possible.
						<br><br>
						For the standby shifts in the middle of the night, it is fine if you go to sleep. If you go to sleep during your shift,
						please place a pylon in front of your bed to indicate that you’re the person that is on first-aid duty and can be woken up when necessary.
						We will remove the pylon at the end of your shift.
						<br><br>
						During the competition we have scheduled one open-class dancer and one breitensport-dancer such that always one of you will be available.
