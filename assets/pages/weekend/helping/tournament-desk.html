						<h2>When do I have to be there?</h2>
						Please report at the tournament desk at <b>08:00</b>. Preparation is the night before at <b>00:00</b>.
						<h2>To whom do I need to report?</h2>
						The tournament manager for the entire weekend is Joanna Wytrzyszczewska. For any questions, go to her. If she cannot answer them, she will pass on the question to Remy.
						<h2>Who has final say?</h2>
						For any ordinary changes and decisions, the tournament chairman has final say. For anything out of the ordinary, Remy should be fetched who has final say.
						The tournament manager, Joanna Wytrzyszczewska, has the power to cut any discussion if necessary.
						<h2>In which cases should Remy be fetched?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The system is down. Also fetch Alen</li>
							<li>The system is showing difficulties. Also fetch Alen</li>
							<li>There is a tie before the finals an Open class.</li>
							<li>There is a big delay and something needs to be cut from the schedule.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>In which cases should Remy NOT be fetched?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>There is just a small delay. Just reduce the song play time.</li>
							<li>A judge is missing for more than 2 minutes. - The judge will be replaced by another judge under that name.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>What are the default music lengths?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>During the qualification rounds (both breiten and open), as well as the general look of the beginners: <b>1:15</b></li>
							<li>During all other rounds (except for the finals): <b>1:20 - 1:25</b></li>
							<li>During the finals: <b>1:25 - 1:30</b></li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Unconventional things</h2>
						There is a beginners class!
						<br><br>
						The open class has a qualification round that then splits into two classes. No big deal. However, after this they go by the names:
						<ul>
							<li>Rising Ravers - Or Ravers for short - Which replace the Closed class (rising is to indicate the lower level)</li>
							<li>Risen Robots - Or Robots for short - Which replace the Open class (risen is to indicate the higher level)</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						The open class qualification as well as the ravers and robots have changing dances up to and including the quarter-finals.
						These will be simply pulled from a hat and will be danced in the order they are drawn in. The drawing should be done when the first heat of the dance is on the floor.
						However, the second dance will only be announced after all heats of the first dance have taken place. The same goes for the third dance.
						<br><br>
						The ravers and robots will have a lottery starting in their semi-finals. For the semi-finals, the order will be announced in advance through the portal.
						For the final, the order will not be announced in advance.
						Instead, please ask everyone on the floor and ask them to line up in the order we give you.
