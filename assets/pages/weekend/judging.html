								First and foremost, you are NOT judging a national competition. You are judging an ETDS.
								This means that people are not used to dancing with each other.
								Partnering and musicality is of a much higher difficulty than just basic technique.
								Does the couple take a big risk to thrill the crowd, but in return slightly lower the technical standard?
								Does the couple have a large height difference, but do they still manage to show partnering even though the frame is not amazing?
								Those should be rewarded rather than frowned upon.
								Of course, technique still plays a large part in judging, but don't let it overtake your judgement.
								<br><br>
								On top of that, the ETDS is about fun. Both in the dancer and in the adjudicator.
								Unlike normal competitions, judges are allowed and expect to smile and interact with the dancers and even each other if the situation permits.

								While the doors of the venue will likely be opened as early as 07:00, please be present at the latest at the following times:
								<br><br>
								Please be there at the latest at <b>08:30</b><br>
								<br><br>
								The competition is planned to end at 18:30. Do note that this is an estimate time, and we may run late.
								While you are free to leave after your last final, we kindly invite you to stay for the parties.
								<br><br>
								Make sure you are in the tournament hall at least 2 minutes before your round starts, so you can login.
								In case you are late to your round. Even if it is because youâ€™re still on the toilet, we have a very important tournament policy:
								<div class="centeredButtonContainer"><b style="text-align: center">2 minute replacement</b></div>
								This means that if, for whatever reason, you are more than 2 minutes late, you will be immediately replaced by the first backup adjudicator under your name.
								That last part is due the limitations of the judging system. The replacement will last for that round only, so you can return to judging after.
								We understand that this is an unconventional approach, however, with 7 classes and over 600 couples participating every day, we cannot afford to run late.
								So please make sure you are on time, even with your bathroom breaks.

								The system is fairly straight forward to use. While you will hear the summary during your briefing, here are some quick pointers:
								<ul>
									<li>At the top of the screen you will see:
										<ul>
											<li>the number of (or range of) crosses you need to give,</li>
											<li>the number of heats,</li>
											<li>the name of the current dance,</li>
											<li>the number of crosses you have given,</li>
											<li>and the number of couples you have noted.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>The color of the top bar indicates the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Red: you have crossed too few or too many couples</li>
										<li>Green: you have scored the right amount of couples</li>
										<li>Blue: you have scored the right amount of couples but you still have some couples noted</li>
									</ul>
									You always try to aim for green or blue.
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>To cross a couple you tap the empty box below their number</li>
									<li>To un-cross a couple you tap the crossed box below their number</li>
									<li>To note/mark a couple for your own convenience you tap their number. The note is indicated by a number of dots.</li>
									<li>A couple can have 1, 2, or 3 dots/notes. You can use this, for example, to distinguish couples you have seen, may want to cross, or are sure you do not want to cross.</li>
									<li>In case the system is slow or fails to respond, please refresh the page or tap the top bar.</li>
									<li>In case the system does not respond even after a refresh, please DO NOT keep refreshing, but report at the tournament desk.
										Meanwhile, please finish the marking of that heat in a note on your phone or with pen and paper.</li>
									<li>In the finals, you score couples by tapping the placing next to their number.</li>
								</ul>

								If a couple misses their heat, they get another chance by dancing in the last heat.
								Their number will be moved by the tournament office to that heat, so no intervention needs to be done on your part.
